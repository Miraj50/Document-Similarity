# Document-Similarity

The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive 'Document Similarity' system to help point out similar content if any in the given 
set of documents. The system will have two modules: one which is restricted for two documents which will help us find similarities 
between them and highlight the patches in the two documents which might be similar. The other module will be for set of multiple 
documents which will help us to cluster them into group based on their content. The front-end interface for the system will be a web-page 
to take input from the user in the form of text, pdfs, images or url of the content.
