I am a student currently studying at IIT Bombay, India. I am pursuing Computer Science and Engineering and presently I am in my first year.
I am applying  for financial aid because I am a student and I do not have any means of income. So, I will not be able to pay the required sum for taking up the above course. We have an option of becoming teaching assistants (they get paid for doing that), but  only in our second year. Also I come from a middle class family. I told my father about this course. Well he said that why don't you take up a course which is free. I have seen, in detail the syllabus of other courses also, and I think this course is better than them. So I had decided that I would try taking up this course first. I am very interested in learning data structures and algorithms. So please consider my request.




I am a computer science and engineering student and therefore it is imperative  that i have a good (in fact excellent) knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I believe data structures and algorithms are the basic building blocks of any application. I am very interested in learning how we can optimize algorithms (till now I have been writing brute force ones), know about various efficient existing algorithms , etc. I also  believe this course will help me increase my level and area of thinking , which will eventually help me in writing elegant and efficient programs, do a bit of competitive coding , (in short , become a better programmer). There are so many competitions which take place around the world, say on hackerrank, codechef, etc. I also want to participate in them. Now, if I participate, I am only able to solve at max two out of five problems (hackerrank), sometimes three. 




As I have said above, I am a student and I have no means of income and therefore I wont be able to pay any amount that this course asks me for.
